High resolution wrapped phase estimation for InSAR

<!-- DeformatiOn Land surface Products in High resolution using INsar -->


🚨 This toolbox is still in **pre-alpha** stage and undergoing **rapid development**. 🚨


## Usage

The main entry point for running the phase estimation workflow is named `dolphin`, which has two subcommands:

1. `dolphin config`: create a workflow configuration file.
2. `dolphin run` : run the workflow using this file.

Example usage:

```bash
$ dolphin config --slc-files /path/to/slcs/*tif
```
This will create a YAML file (by default `dolphin_config.yaml` in the current directory).

The only required inputs for the workflow is a list of coregistered SLC files (in either geographic or radar coordinates).
If the SLC files are spread over multiple files, you can either
1. use the `--slc-files` option with a bash glob pattern, (e.g. `dolphin config --slc-files merged/SLC/*/*.slc` would match the [ISCE2 stack processor output](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2/tree/main/contrib/stack) )
1. Store all input SLC files in a text file delimited by newlines (e.g. `my_slc_list.txt`), and give the name of this text file prefixed by the `@` character (e.g. `dolphin config --slc-files @my_slc_list.txt`)

The full set of options is written to the configuration file; you can edit this file, or you can see which commonly tuned options by are changeable running `dolphin config --help`.
